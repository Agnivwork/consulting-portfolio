                <h3>Investigating the Influence of India's Midday Meal Scheme on Primary Education and Nutrition</h3>
                <p>Project Overview
This project analyzed the impact of India's Midday Meal Scheme (MDM) on primary education enrollment, attendance, and nutritional status of children. The study used time-series data and econometric analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme.

Objectives
To assess the impact of the MDM scheme on primary school enrollment and attendance.

To evaluate the nutritional benefits of the MDM scheme.

To propose improvements to the scheme based on empirical findings.

Methodology
Data Source: Educational Statistics at a Glance (ESAG-2018) published by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.

Time Period: Data from 1960 to 2014, divided into pre- and post-MDM implementation periods.

Variables: Enrollment rates, Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER), and dropout rates.

Analysis: Time-series analysis, regression analysis, and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach using Stata.

Key Findings
The MDM scheme led to a significant increase in primary school enrollment, particularly among girls.

Dropout rates decreased by 20% in the post-MDM period.

Nutritional improvements were observed, but further enhancements are needed to meet daily dietary requirements.

Conclusion
The MDM scheme has been successful in improving educational outcomes and nutritional status among primary school children. However, there is a need for continuous monitoring and policy adjustments to maximize its impact.</p>

Variables: GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and foreign debt.

Analysis: Macroeconomic trend analysis, forecasting models, and comparative analysis with other South Asian countries.

Key Findings
Sri Lanka's economic collapse was primarily due to policy failures, excessive foreign debt, and the collapse of the tourism industry.

The crisis led to severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel, significantly impacting the population's well-being.

Other South Asian nations, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, show similar vulnerabilities and need to implement preventive measures.
